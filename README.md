# **ytmp3-dl**

This is a python script that uses a specific python package **youtube-dl**. It will download the audio file from any video/audio link provided during the execution of the program, and if necessary converts it to **.mp3** format of high quality. Downloads are done in a multithreaded way, so faster downloads âš¡.

## General

- The system must have **python** installed and set to the global path. _(downlaod [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) as per your Operating System. **check** the 'Add Python to system PATH' option while installing in **Windows**)_

- Download the **ytmp3-dl** folder from [here](https://github.com/poseidon-code/ytmp3-dl/archive/master.zip 'ytmp3-dl').

- Open up **cmd** (**terminal** for Linux/macOS).

- **cd** into the directory where you have downloaded the **ytmp3-dl** folder.

  _**otherwise** if your **DEFAULT** Downloads location is C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\Downloads (as of most Windows PC), then write this in **cmd**._

  ```cmd
  C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME> cd downloads\ytmp3-dl
  C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\Downloads\ytmp3-dl>
  ```

- Copy the video URL that you want to download. _e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2NN3tmCVI8_

- While inside the **ytmp3-dl** directory, run the `python mp3.py` command:

  ```cmd
  C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\Downloads\ytmp3-dl> python mp3.py
  ```

  and paste the URL _(mouse right-click)_:

  ```cmd
  C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\Downloads\ytmp3-dl> python mp3.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2NN3tmCVI8
  ```

  you can add multiple URLs _(just add space between URLs)_:

  ```cmd
  C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\Downloads\ytmp3-dl> python mp3.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2NN3tmCVI8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kddC4gi72UE
  ```

  then press **Enter**.

- All the files will be downloaded to the **DEFAULT** Downloads location : _C:\Users\YOUR-PC-NAME\Downloads (as of most Windows OS)_

- You are GOOD NOW ðŸ˜Š

## Customizing

Various options of downloading can be added directly to the **mp3.py** script. To add custom options, follow these steps _(make sure **python** is installed in your system & PATH is set)_:

- Open **mp3.py** with a suitable text editor.
- Press **Ctrl + F** or start **Find** feature of your editor and search for **" OPTIONAL "**.
- Under **OPTIONAL** you can add multitude of Custom Options to make your script unique.
- Enter your desired options by adding a ' **,** ' _(comma)_ at the end of every option you add.
- Yor code will look like this :

  ```python
  options = {
      # PERMANENT options        <--- DON'T CHANGE these options
      'quite': True,
      'format': 'bestaudio/best',
      'ffmpeg_location': f'{ffmpeg_path}/ffmpeg.exe',
      'keepvideo': False,
      'outtmpl': f'{download_path}/%(title)s.bin',
      'postprocessors': [{
          'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
          'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
          'preferredquality': '320'
      }],

      #(OPTIONAL options)        <--- ADD options from here
      'noplaylist': True,
      'options': 'value',
          .       .
          .       .
          .       .
  }
  ```
